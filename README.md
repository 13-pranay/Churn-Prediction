# Churn-Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine customer churn using machine learning techniques. The model analyzes customer data to predict whether a customer will leave a service or continue using it.

Features :

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Model Building with Machine Learning Algorithms

Model Evaluation

Prediction and Result Interpretation
